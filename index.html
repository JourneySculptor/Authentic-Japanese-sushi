        <ul>
          <li><strong>Eating with Fingers:</strong> Nigirizushi is traditionally eaten with the fingers, even in formal settings. Sashimi, on the other hand, is typically eaten with chopsticks.</li>
          <li><strong>Dipping in Soy Sauce:</strong> When dipping sushi in soy sauce, turn the piece so that only the topping touches the sauce. This prevents the rice from absorbing too much soy sauce and falling apart.</li>
          <li><strong>Wasabi:</strong> Traditionally, the chef adds the appropriate amount of wasabi to the sushi. It's usually not necessary to add more, though many restaurants now serve wasabi on the side.</li>
        </ul>
